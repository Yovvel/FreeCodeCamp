			<p>Now a vastly popular MMORPG, The Elder Scrolls series has
				come a long way since the arena combat game released in 1994.
				The world and lore has expanded and continues to sprout on
				to new platforms from collectible card games to open worlds.
				Here you'll find a history of The Elder Scrolls Games...</p>

				<h3>The Elder Scrolls: Arena - 1994</h3>
				<p>Beginning as an arena combat game, Arena soon became so much
					more than that, an unforgiving RPG quest game,
					where you needed to free the emperor Uriel Septim VII from
					the Imperial Battlemage. Arena is the title in which you
					must prove yourself worthy of the land of Tamriel.</p>

					<h3>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall - 1996</h3>
					<p>Daggerfall opened up The Elder Scrolls universe,
						to make the game feel more like a world, with large empty expanses
						and juicy politics and guilds.</p>

					<p>You could wander round and chat to people, buy your own house and
						it was the first game in the series where The Elder Scrolls games
						formed a solid identity.The game was incredibly clever, with
						multiple diverse endings which spun and affected future games.</p>

						<h3>An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire - 1997</h3>
						<p>Wavering slightly from previous Elder Scrolls entries,
							Battlespire focuses on the demonic threat that's taken over the
							land. Much more of a dungeon crawler than the open world RPG games
							we've come to know and love.</p>

							<h3>The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard - 1998</h3>
							<p>A very different type of game to previous Elder Scrolls entries
								in the series. This third person action adventure puzzler
								doesn't allow you to choose your character. Instead you take on
								the role of Cyrus, a Redguard on the island where the game is
								set. Searching for your missing sister, this game is more story
								driven and focussed on events instead of customisation and
								personalised playstyle.</p>

							<h3>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind - 2002</h3>
							<p>The start of Morrowind and the way the game became more
								diverse, stretching out from Daggerfall's sometime bleak
								appearance, is what really made this game come alive. Morrowind
								was set in the island of Vvardenfell and was a crafted,dark
								land, with tonnes of player freedom, making this game and the
								beautiful island of Vvardenfell an Elder Scrolls fan favourite.
								Morrowind is coming back to Elder Scrolls, in the form of an
								expansion for Elder Scroll Online the popular MMO in the series.</p>

							<h3>The Elder Scrolls Travels: Stormhold, Dawnstar, and Shadowkey - 2003/2004</h3>
							<p>When The Elder Scrolls universe took to mobile, before the
								iPhone was even released. In a time where tiny screens and
								clunky keypads took up most the phone. A simple Elder Scrolls
								experience.</p>

							<h3>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - 2006</h3>
							<p>Another of the larger titles to launch from The Elder Scrolls
								series, Oblivion was set in Cyrodil, a region not visited since
								the first game Arena. Another open world in the series, the
								landscape is very different to that of Morrowind, transporting
								back to the mundane setting of Daggerfall. However, the gameplay
								experience came on leaps and bounds, injecting heaps of
								intriguing quests, fantastic interactions and a boundary of
								interesting places.</p>

							<h3>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - 2011</h3>
							<p>Possibly one of the most talked about game in The Elder Scrolls
								series, Skyrim became a universally loved game between fans of
								the series and newcomers. The 200 year leap from the last game,
								was set in a region crammed with war, politics and dragons!
								Skyrim really captured people's attention with the variety of
								beautiful and threatening settings.</p>

							<h3>The Elder Scrolls Online - 2014</h3>
							<p>The first MMO in the series, ESO takes place over most of
								Tamriel with a base story being the threat of war. This game
								grasps the play your own way and customisation features that
								fans love in previous games and ran with it, so players can make
								their own mark on the game. ESO continues to be updated and
								expansions released, including the upcoming Morrowind.</p>

							<h3>The Elder Scrolls: Legends - 2017</h3>
							<p>Another platform for Bethesda to try with The Elder Scrolls
								universe, the game launched as a collectible card game. The game
								is free to play and lets you go up against opponents in 1v1 card
								battles.</p>
