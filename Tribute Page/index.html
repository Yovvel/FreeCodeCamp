					<h2>Why a tribute page to Python?</h2>
					<p>Why you may ask? Well, the first reason i wrote this tribute site is because it is one of the objectives for the <a href="www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a> certification. So, building this website wasn't very tough, but now i have to think about a topic to write about.</p>
					<p>The first thing i was thinking about was about a specific person that has done something to change to world or something, or a famous person, but to be honest, that is absolutely not my thing.</p>
					<p>So i kept thinking about a topic to write about until finaly the answer came to my mind! Lets not write a tribute page about a person, but about a thing! Let write a page about one of my favorite programming languages out here:</p>
					<h3>python!</h3>
					<p>Why Python? well, it is certenly not the first programming language i learned, but it is the first language which helped me to go deeper into programming than ever before.
					At the age of 10 i made my first program using Qbasic, with just some simple sentences and questions asked which the program repeated. something like that, nothing fancy. At school i learned to program microprocessors like the PICmicro in a BASIC language. Stil nothing fancy, i learned mostly to give the microprocessor some instruction. But when my understanding of programming really took off, was when i was doing a Python course from the university of Migichan at <a href="www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>.</p>
					<p>Python is a language which is easy to understand without any hard syntaxes to understand. it almost looks like psuedo code. It is almost like write native english. There are programmers out there that will write in Python when they have to write an algoritmh to explain something to somebody. For every non-programmer, Python is a good first language to learn and use. I will not say that Python is the best language because every language has their own advantages and disvantages. But for now, we only take a look at Python.</p>

					<h2 id="headline">What is Python?</h2>
					<p>Python is a programming language, released in 1991, written by Guido van Rossum.The language is based on the insights from professor Lambert Meertens, who wrote the language ABC, which is based on BASIC, but with all sorts of very sophisticated data structures. It's design philosophy is based around readability, notable using significant white spaces.</p>
					<p>Python has gotten his name thanks to Guido's favorite television show: "Monty Python's Flying Circus".</p>

					<h3>History</h3>
					<p>Guido Van Rossum published the first version of Python code (version 0.9.0) at alt.sources in February 1991. This release included already exception handling, functions, and the core data types of list, dict, str and others. It was also object oriented and had a module system.</p>
					<p>Python version 1.0 was released in January 1994. and 6 years later, 2.0 was released. this version ruled the world for 8 years, when in 2008 3.0 was released</p>
					<p>All versions where backward compatible, except for the latest version.</p>
