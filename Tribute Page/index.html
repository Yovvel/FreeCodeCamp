			<p>Now a vastly popular MMORPG, The Elder Scrolls series has
				come a long way since the arena combat game released in 1994.
				The world and lore has expanded and continues to sprout on
				to new platforms from collectible card games to open worlds.
				Here you’ll find a history of The Elder Scrolls Games…</p>

				<h3>The Elder Scrolls: Arena - 1994</h3>
				<p>Beginning as an arena combat game, Arena soon became so much
					more than that, an unforgiving RPG quest game,
					where you needed to free the emperor Uriel Septim VII from
					the Imperial Battlemage. Arena is the title in which you
					must prove yourself worthy of the land of Tamriel.</p>

					<h3>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall – 1996</h3>
					<p>Daggerfall opened up The Elder Scrolls universe,
						to make the game feel more like a world, with large empty expanses
						and juicy politics and guilds.</p>

					<p>You could wander round and chat to people, buy your own house and
						it was the first game in the series where The Elder Scrolls games
						formed a solid identity.The game was incredibly clever, with
						multiple diverse endings which spun and affected future games.</p>

						<h3>An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire – 1997</h3>
