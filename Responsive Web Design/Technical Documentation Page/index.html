        <p>AutoCAD is computer-aided design (CAD) software that architects, engineers, and construction professionals rely on to create precise 2D and 3D drawings.</p>
        <p>This guide is a great place to get started if you just completed your initial training, or to refresh your memory if you use AutoCAD only occasionally. The included commands are grouped together according to types of activity, and are arranged to follow a general workflow. </p>

          <p>After you launch AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT, click the Start Drawing button to begin a new drawing.</p>

          <p>You'll notice a standard tabbed ribbon across the top of the drawing area. You can access nearly all the commands presented in this guide from the Home tab. In addition, the Quick Access toolbar shown below includes familiar commands such as New, Open, Save, Print, and Undo. </p>

        <article>
          <p>
            At the heart of the program is the Command window, which is normally docked at the bottom of the application window. The Command window displays prompts, options, and messages.</p> 
            <img src="https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2019/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/images/GUID-32F9FC20-332F-4AE3-B9C0-943F4B376E75.png" alt="command prompt">
          <p>You can enter commands directly in the Command window instead of using the ribbon, toolbars, and menus. Many long-time users prefer this method.</p>
          <p>Notice that as you start to type a command, it completes automatically. When several possibilities are available such as in the example below, you can make your choice by clicking it or using the arrow keys and then pressing Enter or the Spacebar.</p>

          <p>Tip: When you look for an option, try right-clicking. Depending on where you locate your cursor and whether you're in command, the menu that displays will provide relevant commands and options.</p>

          <p>You can easily conform to industry or company standards by specifying settings for text, dimensions, linetypes, and several other features. For example, this backyard deck design displays two different dimension styles. </p>

          <p>All these settings can be saved in a drawing template file. Click New to choose from several drawing template files: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>For imperial drawings that assume your units are inches, use acad.dwt or acadlt.dwt. </li>
            <li>For metric units that assume your units are millimeters, use acadiso.dwt or acadltiso.dwt.</li>
          </ul>

            <p>The "Tutorial" template files in the list are simple examples for the architectural or mechanical design disciplines with both imperial (i) and metric (m) versions. You might want to experiment with them.</p>
            <p>Most companies use drawing template files that conform to company standards. They will often use different drawing template files depending on the project or the client.</p>

            <p>You can save any drawing (.dwg) file as a drawing template (.dwt) file. You can also open any existing drawing template file, modify it, and then save it again, with a different filename if needed.</p>
            <img src="https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2019/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/images/GUID-E784E0DB-E4DB-4390-8727-D4972C566F76.png" alt="">
            <p>If you work independently, you can develop your drawing template files to suit your working preferences, adding settings for additional features as you become familiar with them. 
            </p>
            <p>To modify an existing drawing template file, click Open, specify Drawing Template (*.dwt) in the Select File dialog box, and choose the template file. </p>        
            <img src="https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2019/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/images/GUID-008B7B90-F1FB-46C3-A5D1-4C9E2F927C70.png" alt="">
            <p>Important: If your company has already established a set of drawing template files, check with your CAD manager before modifying any of them. </p>

            <p>After you start a new drawing, you'll first decide what the length of one unit representsâ€”an inch, a foot, a centimeter, a kilometer, or some other unit of length. For example, the objects below could represent two buildings that are each 125 feet long, or they could represent a section from a mechanical part that is measured in millimeters. </p>

          <header>Unit Display Settings</header>
          <article>
            <p>After you decide what unit of length that you want to use, the UNITS command lets you control several unit display settings including the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Format (or Type). For example, a decimal length of 6.5 can be set to display as a fractional length of 6-1/2 instead. </li>
              <li>Precision. For example, a decimal length of 6.5 can be set to display as 6.50, 6.500, or 6.5000. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you plan to work in feet and inches, use the UNITS command to set the unit type to Architectural, and then when you create objects, specify their lengths in inches. If you plan to use metric units, leave the unit type set to Decimal. Changing the unit format and precision does not affect the internal precision of your drawing. It affects only how lengths, angles, and coordinates are displayed in the user interface.</p>
            <p>Tip: If you change a setting for the unit display or any other setting, you can save the settings in a drawing template file. Otherwise, you'll need to change the settings for each new drawing. </p>
