# Responsive Web Design Projects

To show what i have learned from the lessons on FreeCodeCamp, the course gave me 5 projects to work on.
In here you can find the source code and a link to codepen or each solution to see the project live.

These are the 5 projects:
  *Build a Tribute Page
    Codepen link: [Tribute to Python](https://codepen.io/Yovvel/pen/BvVXLV)
  * Build a Survey Form
  * Build a Product Landing Page
