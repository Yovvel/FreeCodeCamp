# FreeCodeCamp
FreeCodeCamp is a course which will help you get ready and land a programming job.
In total there are 6 certifications to get, each will cost around 300 hours, depening on you experience.
The goal is to learn, not just finish as fast as possible.
Each course part has some valuable lessons you can follow along and try out in the code editor built into the site and giving you some challenges on the run. Besides of doing those challenges, somethimes i search for mor information about this topic to get a better understanding about the topic.
You can find a live version of each project on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Yovvel/).


## Responsive Web Design Projects
After i have finished all the lessons, i had to build 5 sites to show what i have learned from the lessons.
Here you can find the [source code](https://github.com/Yovvel/FreeCodeCamp/tree/fileReplacement/Responsive%20Web%20Design) for the 5 responsive web design projects. See the links below to see a live version of each project. 

These are the 5 projects:
  * Build a Tribute Page
  * Build a Survey Form
  * Build a Product Landing Page
  
  Comming soon:
  * Build a Technical Documentation Page
  * Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage
  
  ### Build a Tribute Page
  The goal was to build a tribute page similar to this [codepen]( https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx).
  To do so, there where 6 user story's that i had to implement.
  The first step for me was to think of a subject to write this page about. For me this was the hardest part, because there aren't any person's that had done something increadible worth mentioning for me, so i choose not to write a tribute page about a person, but about a programming language, just to stay on topic where this course is all about! I choose to write about Python.
  I used css Flexbox for the 3 lists about the history of Python. For the rest i just used basic HTML & CSS. When i think back to it, maybe i could use flexbox for the rest of the site to make it more responsive.
 Here you can find the [source code](Responsive Web Design/Tribute Page/) and a live version you can find on [codepen](https://codepen.io/Yovvel/full/BvVXLV).
