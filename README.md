# FreeCodeCamp
FreeCodeCamp is a course which will help you get ready and land a programming job.
In total there are 6 certifications to get, each will cost around 300 hours, depening on you experience.
The goal is to learn, not just finish as fast as possible.
Each course part has some valuable lessons you can follow along and try out in the code editor built into the site and giving you some challenges on the run. Besides of doing those challenges, somethimes i search for more information about this topic to get a better understanding about the topic.
You can find a live version of each project on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Yovvel/).


## Responsive Web Design Projects
After i have finished all the lessons, i had to build 5 sites to show what i have learned from the lessons.
Here you can find the [source code](https://github.com/Yovvel/FreeCodeCamp/tree/fileReplacement/Responsive%20Web%20Design) for the 5 responsive web design projects. See the links below to see a live version of each project.

These are the 5 projects:
  * Build a Tribute Page
  * Build a Survey Form
  * Build a Product Landing Page
  * Build a Technical Documentation Page

  Comming soon:
  * Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage

### Build a Tribute Page
  The goal was to build a tribute page similar to this [codepen](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx).
  To do so, there where 6 user story's that i had to implement.
  The first step for me was to think of a subject to write this page about. For me this was the hardest part, because there aren't any person's that had done something increadible worth mentioning for me, so i choose not to write a tribute page about a person, but about a programming language, just to stay on topic where this course is all about! I choose to write about Python.
  I used css Flexbox for the 3 lists about the history of Python. For the rest i just used basic HTML & CSS. When i think back to it, maybe i could use flexbox for the rest of the site to make it more responsive.
 Here you can find the [source code](Responsive Web Design/Tribute Page/) and a live version you can find on [codepen - Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/Yovvel/full/BvVXLV).

### Build a Survey Form
 The goal was to build a Survey Form page similar to this [codepen](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP).
 There where 16 user story's to implement. Mostly they where about
 You can find the[source code](Responsive Web Design/Survey Form) here and a live version of this page you can find on [Codepen - Survey form](https://codepen.io/Yovvel/pen/OrawJr).

### Build a Technical Documentation Page
  The goal was to build a Technical Documentation page that is functionally similar to this [codepen](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL).
  Altough the purpose was to write a page about HTML,CSS or JavaScript, but i choose to write a page about AutoCad, because i use Autocad in my current job.
  By taking this road, i had to do one trick to pass all the user stories, beacause i didn't had any use for the "/<code>" part. I solved this to place 5 "/<code>" parts in the html and used CSS to hide those. This way the script will pass the user story, but the user will not see them.
  The code i wrote, you can find [here](/Responsive Web Design/Technical Documentation Page/) and the live version you can find on [codepen - Autocad Documentation Page](https://codepen.io/Yovvel/pen/NJNQed).
